Simple Distributed File System
We desined a SDFS which is tolerant up to two machine failures at a time. SDFS
is a flat file system with no concept of directions. 
The allowed file ops include: 
 1). put localfilename sdfsfilename
 2). get sdfsfilename localfilename(fetches to local dir)
 3). delete sdfsfilename 
 Our project is built thourgh maven. 
 To run our project in your computer, you should first change the predefined
 introducers in membership folder according to your own ip. And change the 
 original master in the LeaderElection.java according to your ips. 
 Then, you can use the command - mvn assembly:assembly to package our project 
 into an executeable jar file - mp3.jar. Then, use java -jar mp3.jar to run.
